Hello, I'm Mengxing, a Ph.D. researcher in Human-Computer Interaction, exploring how human values can be embedded in mixed reality experiences. I'm also the Co-Founder of Leman Times, a startup dedicated to tackling challenges in an ageing society.

My academic journey started with a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics, followed by a master’s in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and now, my Ph.D. focuses on the intersection of immersive technology, ethics, and human values. Throughout my studies, I've been fortunate to receive multiple honours, including the State Scholarship, the Excellent Graduate Award, the Excellent Thesis Award, Alumni Ambassador, Monash Graduate Scholarship, and Monash International Tuition Scholarship.

Beyond academia, I've gained hands-on experience through internships at the United Nations (UNEP, UNESCO, ESCAP), the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and leading tech companies like Neusoft and "Bus Coming." I've also contributed to international projects, such as the UNEP International Ecosystem Management Partnership (IEMP) and the Smart Classroom Project in Africa. In addition, I've worked as a Research Assistant at Tsinghua University and a coach at the Monash Innovation Guarantee (MIG).

Outside of research and tech, I'm deeply passionate about animals and nature. I've volunteered with organisations like the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), Green Camps, and the Winter Clothing Donation Program. I believe in creating a smarter, warmer, and more inclusive world—whether through technology, education, or value-driven design.

Always open to collaborations, meaningful conversations, and new opportunities—let’s connect!
